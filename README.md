The work is being supported by the technical staff at the Economic Research and the IP Analytics team at the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO). I would like to extend my gratitude for their generosity in sharing their knowledge and expertise.

### USPTO Data 
Folder USPTO_Data contains some data initial exploration using data from USPTO. UPSTO has three different public use datasets, including downloadable tables from USPTO website and downloadable and API from Patentsivew - a third party data host. Among the three options, data hosted by Patentsview has the most documentation. The methodology of how Patentsview built and improve the dataset is well documentated. The initial intent is to replicate some basic facts about US patents used in previous research and publications. Data is imperfect. The raw data contains empty cells and duplicates. Adding correction for such actually contradicts to data work by previous researchers. In the work file under USPTO_Data, I have also added the general trends of patents filed at USPTO segmented by countries including China, Canada, France and Japan. The data work shows trends:
1.China has been massively applying for IP worldwide
2.Sharp decline in patent application during COVID-19 outbreak (2020)

### Research Proposal on IPR of Basic Research in Two-Countries Setup
Folder IPR_Two_Countries contains the work in progress in drafting a research proposal on IPR of Basic Research in Two-Countries Setup. The intent is to investigate the impact of retaining or not intellectual property rights (IPR) of basic research in one country on the dynamics of growth in a two-countries setup. Current literature is focused on closed economy. As highlighted by empirical evidence, the linkage between productivity and wage is rather weak in smaller and more open economy. Previous literature shows that the linkage between productivity and wage may be determined by global driving forces rather than domestically. The proposed research aims to assess theoretically and quantitatively the impact of IPR basic in a two-countries setup on employment and productivity. At the poli
